**Last Updated:** December 13, 2014

Here's some info on my current / recommended setup - I'm always refining my tools and configuration, so this page will change over time. &nbsp;But this is a snapshot of roughly right now. &nbsp;:)

## Hardware

*   27-inch iMac with Retina 5K
*   13" Retina MacBook Pro, Late 2013 Model
*   Apple Wired Keyboard
*   Razer DeathAdder 2013 Mouse
*   iPhone 6 Plus, 64GB
*   iPad Air 2, 64GB

## Software

I've used multiple text editor packages, and have landed on **Sublime Text** as my favorite. &nbsp;Prior to ST3 and ST2, I used TextMate and Coda briefly. &nbsp;I may eventually like Atom, but it's still too young for me.

**Dash** is amazing for code documentation.

**Evernote** is great for long-term storage of searchable stuff (important papers, receipts, etc.)

For password management, I use **1Password**, which remembers all of my passwords in an encrypted format and syncs with all my devices via Dropbox. &nbsp;It's nice. &nbsp;I also keep secure notes in there too, like software license keys and bank account information.

I subscribe to Creative Cloud, but on a day to day basis really prefer **Pixelmator**.

For photo storage and organization, I'm currently letting **Dropbox** store all my photos via camera upload. &nbsp;It's simple, and I like it, though if I ever do any serious photography, I'll need something better, with more organization and storage space.

I use **Google Hangouts** for personal instant messages, in addition to the&nbsp;**Messages**&nbsp;app for iMessages. &nbsp;**Slack** is for work, and it's awesome.

For IRC, **IRCCloud** is great, with persistent connections and web and mobile clients. &nbsp;Textual is nice if you're looking for a native app.

For minimalist text editors, I like **iA Writer Pro**&nbsp;a lot. &nbsp;It has both local and iCloud support, which is nice.

**Plex** is an&nbsp;_awesome_ media center. &nbsp;You should use it. &nbsp;It's really nice.

For development, I have the Xcode command line tools package installed, along with **Homebrew** for software.

**ImageOptim** is cool because it optimizes images easily to shrink the size while maintaining quality.

There's lots of productivity apps out there, none of which am I using well, but for scratch lists I do use **Wunderlist**. &nbsp;I've tried Things and Clear in the past but haven't stuck with them.

For music, I've been leaning towards **Beats Audio** these days, with purchased music in **iTunes**. &nbsp;Of course there's Playlist too. &nbsp;;) &nbsp;I used to be a Spotify fan. &nbsp;I used to be a Pandora One subscriber before converting to Spotify.

For video,&nbsp;**VLC** wins, hands-down, though sometimes I'm lazy and let an MP4 open in QuickTime.

For FTPing stuff to remote servers, there's&nbsp;**Transmit**.

**VirtualBox** and **Vagrant** are both installed, and are useful for development.

**Transmission** is great for torrents. &nbsp;Clean and simple.

**TeamViewer 9**&nbsp;is indispensable when it comes to doing remote support for friends and family, something that happens about half a dozen times per month.

I really love **Jitouch**, as it adds extra gestures and such for the trackpad - highly useful.

For fun, there's&nbsp;**Steam** (with a large library of Humble Bundle games), **StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty**, **League of Legends**, and&nbsp;**LIMBO**. More than enough for my limited game-playing (almost none).

Whenever I need to rip movies, **Handbrake** comes to the rescue. &nbsp;There's also&nbsp;**NoteBurner M4V Converter** for removing the DRM from movies purchased via iTunes (which I've done twice).

For quick audio editing, there's&nbsp;**Audacity**. &nbsp;It really feels like a low-quality port, but it works.

I have&nbsp;Microsoft Office 360 installed, in addition to Pages and Keynote, but lately tend towards **Google Docs** for most everything.

**Memory Clean** is a nice menubar app for watching memory usage and explaining why things are running slowly.

For finances, I use&nbsp;**You Need a Budget** (YNAB). &nbsp;It's excellent, and I love their philosophy. &nbsp;There's Dropbox sync, too.

Cloud storage is really useful and I use both&nbsp;**Dropbox** (for most everything) and&nbsp;**Google Drive** (for backup of my online documents).

I really like the&nbsp;**GitHub** app as a GUI for git, which I use whenever I need a visual representation of what's changed or need to pick and choose specific files or lines for a commit. &nbsp;**DiffMerge** is a good file comparison tool, too, which is somewhat related to git, so that's why it's in the paragraph.

I use **Google Chrome** exclusively as my web browser, and run the beta channel.

**Burn** is for burning CDs. &nbsp;It's nice.

**AirParrot 2** comes in handy for streaming my screen to my Chromecast.

**Alfred** is pretty awesome, though lately I've been just using the new Mavericks Spotlight.

**Bee** is a decent GitHub issues client.

**Caffeine** is great for keeping the screen from dimming.

## Services

**Private Internet Access** is an awesome VPN provider - I use their service regularly. &nbsp;I used to use iVPN.net prior to PIA.

For my webhost, I love&nbsp;**Digital Ocean** - they're awesome. &nbsp;I've used lots of providers over the years - I strongly dislike HostMonster and Media Temple and am okay with DreamHost, Rackspace Cloud, Amazon Web Services, Linode, and prgmr. &nbsp;But Digital Ocean I love...
