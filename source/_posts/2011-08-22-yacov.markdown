I purchased a new MacBook Pro this past week, so to test my image editing skills, I photoshopped an afro onto an image of two of my friends, Blake Shook and Mark Thomas. Ryan Thomas, Mark's brother and another of my good friends, wrote this poem about me (Mark visited the Ukraine lately and thus has taken to calling me Yacov).
